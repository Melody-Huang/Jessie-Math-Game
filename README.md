Math Dinosaur Game

Description:
Math Dinosaur Game is an interactive, web-based educational game that I especially designed and created for my 6 years old daughter with the goal of cultivating her interest in learning mathematics.

Features:
1. Engaging Visuals: Colorful balloons, cute dinosaur characters, and treasure chests create an inviting game environment.
2. Progressive Difficulty: Players start with an egg, which hatches into a baby dinosaur and eventually grows into an adult, mirroring the child's growth in math skills.
3. Basic Math Operations: The game focuses on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, tailored for early young learners.
4. Reward System: Correct answers are rewarded with dinosaur growth and laying new eggs, encouraging continued play and learning.
5. Gentle Animations: Slowly floating balloons provide a soothing, non-distracting background that won't overwhelm young players.

Educational Benefits:
1. Helps children practice basic math operations in a low-pressure environment.
2. Encourages quick mental calculations.
3. Builds confidence in math skills through positive reinforcement.
4. Makes learning math fun and associated with positive experiences.

How to Play:
1. A math problem appears on the screen.
2. The player selects the balloon with the correct answer.
3. Correct answers help the dinosaur grow and eventually lay new eggs.
4. Incorrect answers may cause the dinosaur to shrink or return to the egg stage.
5. The game continues as long as the player has eggs remaining.

Technical Details:
1. Built with React.js
2. Uses CSS for styling and animations.
3. Designed to be easily customizable with different math problems and visual themes.
